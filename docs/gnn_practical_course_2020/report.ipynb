    "- **AgentLimit**: The maximum number of agents that can be observed. Default is `4`.\n",
    "- **NormalizationEnabled**: Whether node and edge features are normalized.\n",
    "- **VisibilityRadius**: The radius in which an agent can 'see', i.e. detect other agents. Default is `50`.\n",
    "- **SelfLoops**: Whether each node has an edge pointing to itself. Default is `False`\n",
    "- **EnabledNodeFeatures**: The list of available node features, given by their string key that the observer should extract from the world and insert into the observation. For a list of available features, refer to the list returned by `GraphObserver.available_node_attributes()`.\n",
    "- **EnabledEdgeFeatures**: The list of available edge features, given by their string key that the observer should extract from the world and insert into the observation. For a list of available features, refer to the list returned by `GraphObserver.available_edge_attributes()`.\n",

    "There are two main interfaces:\n",

    "\n",
    "- The `graph(observations, graph_dims, dense=False)` method basically performs the inverse operation. It accepts a batch of observations (as generated by the `Observe` method) as input and returns a batch of graphs.

    "\n",
    "The resulting actor and critic networks are quite similar in structure. Here's how they work and what they compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Actor Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented in the class `GNNActorNetwork`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: a batch of observations of shape _(batch_size, observation_size)_  \n",
    "**Output**: a batch of a normal distributions over the action space from which the policy will sample the actions performed by the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "![Actor Network Architecture](images/actor_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. GNN**  \n",
    "The observations are directly fed into the graph neural network (a `GNNWrapper` instance). It converts the observations into graphs and computes new node embeddings for each graph by means of message passing and aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**  \n",
    "From here on, we're only interested in the embeddings of the ego agent. Hence, instead of feeding the whole graph representation into the encoding network, we extract the embeddings of the first node of each graph, which represents the ego agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Encoding Network**  \n",
    "In the encoding network, the node embeddings of the ego agent are now passed through a series of dense layers. Depending on the parameters passed into the actor, we can also add convolutions, dropout and other types of layers here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Projection Network**  \n",
    "Finally, the projection network receives the hidden representations after the encoding network and computes a normal distribution over the action space for each observation contained in the batch, modeled by a mean and a standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a very simplified manner for brevity, the implementation of the actor's `call` function looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def call(self, observations, training=False):\n",
    "    # get the updated node embeddings\n",
    "    output = self._gnn(observations, training=training)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # extract the ego state (the first node embedding vector of each batch element)\n",
    "    output = output[:, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # pass the ego agent's node embeddings through the encoder\n",
    "    output = self._encoder(output, training=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # compute a normal distribution\n",
    "    output = self._projection_net(output, training=training)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Critic Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Implemented in the class `GNNCriticNetwork`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: a batch of observation-action pairs, i.e. `[obs, action]` with shapes _(batch_size, observation_size)_ and _(batch_size, 2)_  \n",
    "**Output**: a scalar value assigned to each observation-action pair\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference compared to the actor network is that in the critic, we have two parallel pipelines for the observations and their corresponding actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Critic Network Architecture](images/critic_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Actions**  \n",
    "The actions are simply passed into an action encoding network that works similar to the encoding network of the actor network, i.e. a series of dense layers with optional convolutions, dropout layers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Observations**  \n",
    "The observations are processed in the exact same way as in the actor network. We compute new graph representations in the GNN, extract the ego node embeddings and pass them through an encoding network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Joining Actions and Observations**  \n",
    "After receiving the outputs from the action and observation encoding networks, we concatenate the observation-action pair of each element in the batch to one feature vector.  \n",
    "Finally, we pass this concatenated state through a fully connected joint network which outputs a scalar value for each observation-action pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, a simplified version of the implemenation looks like this:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def call(self, inputs, training=False):\n",
    "    observations, actions = inputs\n",
    "     \n",
    "    # get the updated node embeddings\n",
    "    node_embeddings = self._gnn(observations, training=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # extract the ego state (the first node embedding vector of each batch element)\n",
    "    node_embeddings = node_embeddings[:, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # pass the node embeddings through their observation encoder\n",
    "    node_embeddings = self._observation_encoder(node_embeddings, trainig=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # do the same for the actions with a different action encoder\n",
    "    actions = self._action_encoder(actions, training=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # concatenate observations and actions into one vector\n",
    "    joint = tf.concat([node_embeddings, actions], 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # compute a scalar output value\n",

    "In this part, we briefly introduce a supervised learning setting which helps to quickly debug different actor implementations. It is evaluated whether the actor network is capable of overfitting a small dataset by comparing it to a `RandomActor` and a `ConstantActor`. The `RandomActor` simply outputs a random label within a prespecified bound. The `ConstantActor` on the other hand always outputs the mean label of the training dataset. This chapter demonstrates what we've implemented in `py_gnn_actor_tests`.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### - Phase 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents now have to learn how to actually reach the goal state.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### - Phase 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last phase the agents get more efficient in reaching the goal state.\n",
    "We can see the increase in efficiency by looking at the mean number of steps that each the agent takes per episode. \n",
    "While the agents decrease the number of steps they perform, they keep on increasing the mean reward.\n",
    "As before, the GNN-SAC outperforms the standard SAC when looking at the number of training iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However not all runs of the agents are equal.\n",

    "As we have seen, applying graph neural network to reinforcement learning achieves very promising results. In our project, we used two different libraries: `tf2_gnn` and `spektral`. While `spektral` leverages the use of edge features, `tf2_gnn` does not. It would be interesting to compare the performance of these two library, since edge features would enable the real potential of graph structured data. Another direction is applying graph neural networks to other reinforcement learning algorithms. So far, we only used it with the soft actor critic algorithm. Another good candidate is proximal policy optimization(PPO). It is a good idea to dive deep into the mechanism of graph neural networks and see how it really affects reinforcement learning through these 2 different algorithms. Finally, learning the behavior of an ego agent leads us to the question: Can we use the same model to control the behavior of all other agents? This should be possible since the actor network should generate the same behavior(that maximize the total reward) for each agent. "
