    "# Generative Adverserial Imitation Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) was first proposed in the paper [Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476) by Jonathan Ho and Stefano Ermon. The project task is to implement the Generative Adverserial Imitation Learning model for driving scenarios using the BARK-simulator.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAIL is based on the setting of Reinforcement Learning (RL). In Reinforcment Learning, the agent interacts with the environment through its actions and receives rewards in return. The aim of the learning process is to maximize the cummulative reward by chosing the best action in all states.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, GAIL belongs to a smaller subgroup of RL, called Imitation Learning. In this setup the goal of the agent is to mimic an expert behavior as closely as possible. The environment awards higher rewards to expert-like behavior and smaller ones to actions which substantially deviate from the expert behavior. In our case, expert trajectories were generated from real life data, namely from the Interaction Dataset, as well as from a pretrained SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) agent. The expert trajectories, which are obtained in this way, represent the expert knowledge by containing many states with corresponding actions that were produced by the expert.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, learning of the agent in the RL setting is driven by the rewards it receives from the environment. The amount of the reward in the Imitation Learning setting are determined based on how closely the agent mimics the expert behavior. Special in the GAIL approach is that we receive the reward from an adversarial game: The agent is represented by a generator network which is trained based on the feedback of a discriminator network. The generator produces actions for given states which are then evaluated by the discriminator. In the meantime, the discriminator is trained by feeding it with expert and agent state-action pairs for classification. This way, the generator tries to fool the discriminator, hence he aims at acting as expert-like as possible. Meanwhile, the discriminator tries to distinguish between expert and agent trajectories. Intuitively, learning converges when the generator learned to act so similarly to the expert that the discriminator cannot tell apart expert and agent trajectories any more. In game theory this point is called the Nash-equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the implementation of a GAIL agent is usually solved in the following way for sample efficiency: The agent interacts with the environment by following its actual policy and hence agent state-action pairs are generated. These points are stored in a replay buffer for further learning. After a specified interval a training step is carried out. This training step has 2 substeps: training the discriminator and training the generator networks. \n",
    "* __Discriminator training:__ The discriminator is fed a batch of expert (from the expert trajectories) and agent (from the replay buffer) state-action pairs. It classifies all of them. Based on their true labels the loss is calculated and a gradient descent step is carried out in order to minimize the loss.\n",
    "* __Generator training:__ The generator is fed a batch of states from the replay buffer and it produces actions for them. The resulting state-action pairs are fed to the discriminator for classification. The negative output of the discriminator is used as a loss for the generator network. (Close to -1 if the agent mimics the expert successfully.) The gradient of the loss is propagated all the way back to the generator network to carry out a gradient step to minimize its loss.<br>\n",
    "As already stated, training runs until both, the generator and the discriminator loss, converge to a steady state value.\n",
    "\n",

    "The training process is visualized in the following figure:\n",

    "# Expert Trajectories\n",
    "\n",
    "The Interaction Dataset of course contains trajectories of many different vehicles with different wheel bases. As there are only states recorded in the dataset, we calculate the action the vehicle has taken to go from one state to the next ourselfs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wheel base is used to calculate the action following the [Single Track Model](https://borrelli.me.berkeley.edu/pdfpub/IV_KinematicMPC_jason.pdf). As we are only interested in trajectories with a wheel base as of our agent, we use a fixed wheel base when calculating the actions from the successive states. This however does not restrict the accuracy of the data. We just consider that all state trajectories were carried out by the same car and calculate the actions that a car would have needed to carry out that behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the state variables and also the actions have different magnitudes, we normalize all of them for training. The normalization of the expert trajectories takes place while loading the generated expert trajectories. The loading function also takes the current environment (BARK runtime) as an input, hence the trajectories are normalized according to the current parameters (Current state and action spaces).\n",

    "\n",
    "In this respect, the agent is not in the traditional GAIL setup with 2 neural networks. Instead, it has 5 networks, since the DDPG agent itself has 4 networks for greater stability during training. The DDPG agent's critic network receives the judgement of the discriminator network as the reward from the environment and its training aims to maximize this reward.\n",
