    "## Chapter 5: The Soft-Actor-Critic Algorithm with Graph Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's examine the integrated system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, we have already discussed how the **Soft-Actor-Critic** algorithm works on a high level and how the SAC-agent is integrated into **BARK-ML**. In our case, we want to exploit the graph-like structure of traffic scenarios and have already encoded the state of the world as a graph. Now, we want to apply graph neural networks to the SAC algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting actor and critic networks are quite similar in structure. Here's how they work and what they compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Actor Network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: a batch of observations of shape _(batch_size, observation_size)_  \n",
    "**Output**: a batch of a normal distributions over the action space from which the policy will sample the actions performed by the agent\n",
    "\n",
    "![Actor Network Architecture](images/actor_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. GNN**  \n",
    "The observations are directly fed into the graph neural network (a `GNNWrapper` instance). It converts the observations into graphs and computes new node embeddings for each graph by means of message passing and aggregation. Depending on which GNN library is selected, these embeddings are flattened with a either a pooling (`spektral`) or a global exchange (`tf2_gnn`) layer and finally propagated through a dense layer that outputs flattened graph representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE**  \n",
    "From here on, we're only interested in the embeddings of the ego agent. Hence, instead of feeding the whole graph representation into the encoding network, we extract the embeddings of the first node of each graph, which represents the ego agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Encoding Network**  \n",
    "In the encoding network, the node embeddings of the ego agent are now passed through a series of dense layers. Depending on the parameters passed into the actor, we can also add convolutions, dropout and other types of layers here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Projection Network**  \n",
    "Finally, the projection network receives the hidden representations after the encoding network and computes a normal distribution over the action space for each observation contained in the batch, modeled by a mean and a standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a very simplified manner for brevity, the implementation of the actor's `call` function looks as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def call(self, observations, training=False):\n",
    "    batch_size, feature_len = observations.shape\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # get the updated node embeddings\n",
    "    output = self._gnn(observations, training=training)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # extract the ego state (the first node embedding vector of each batch element)\n",
    "    output = output[:, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # pass the ego agent's node embeddings through the encoder\n",
    "    output = self._encoder(output, training=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # compute a normal distribution\n",
    "    output = self._projection_net(output, training=training)\n",
    "\n",
    "    return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Critic Network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: a batch of observation-action pairs, i.e. `[obs, action]` with shapes _(batch_size, observation_size)_ and _(batch_size, 2)_  \n",
    "**Output**: a scalar value assigned to each observation-action pair\n",
    "\n",
    "![Critic Network Architecture](images/critic_architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The major difference compared to the actor network is that in the critic, we have two parallel pipelines for the observations and their corresponding actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Actions**  \n",
    "The actions are simply passed into an action encoding network that works similar to the encoding network of the actor network, i.e. a series of dense layers with optional convolutions, dropout layers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Observations**  \n",
    "The observations are processed in the exact same way as in the actor network. We compute new graph representations in the GNN, extract the ego node embeddings and pass them through an encoding network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Joining Actions and Observations**  \n",
    "After receiving the outputs from the action and observation encoding networks, we concatenate the observation-action pair of each element in the batch to one feature vector.  \n",
    "Finally, we pass this concatenated state through a fully connected joint network which outputs a scalar value for each observation-action pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, a simplified version of the implemenation looks like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def call(self, inputs, training=False):\n",
    "    observations, actions = inputs\n",
    "    batch_size = observations.shape[0]\n",
    "     \n",
    "    # get the updated node embeddings\n",
    "    node_embeddings = self._gnn.batch_call(observations, training=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # extract the ego state (the first node embedding vector of each batch element)\n",
    "    output = output[:, 0]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # pass the node embeddings through their observation encoder\n",
    "    node_embeddings = self._observation_encoder(node_embeddings, trainig=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # do the same for the actions with a different action encoder\n",
    "    actions = self._action_encoder(actions, training=training)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # concatenate observations and actions into one vector\n",
    "    joint = tf.concat([node_embeddings, actions], 1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # compute a scalar output value\n",
    "    output = self._joint_net(joint, training=training)\n",
    "\n",
