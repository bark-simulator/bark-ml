# BARK-ML Style Guide

This page contains style decisions that both developers and users of BARK-ML
should follow to increase the readability of their code, reduce the
number of errors, and promote consistency.

## Python
We refer to the google python [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
However, instead of a 4 spaces indent, we recommend using a 2 spaces indent.

## CPP
We refer to the google c++ [style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
